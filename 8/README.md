* ``8a.gri`` now permits setting a colorscale before setting the image range. (I don't know if it's sensible to permit this, though.)

* ``8b.gri`` an attempt to get part of a multi-part test suggested by [djraymondnm](https://github.com/dankelley/gri/issues/8#issue-70153124)

* ``8c.gri`` an attempt to get another part of a multi-part test suggested by [djraymondnm](https://github.com/dankelley/gri/issues/8#issue-70153124)

NOTE: 8b and 8c are a bit of a mystery to dankelley. Maybe djraymondnm can help
by suggesting what the expected behaviour is?
