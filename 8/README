* ``8a.gri`` shows that we cannot set up a colorscale before setting a range.
This is consistent with the previous system, which demanded an explicit image
range be set. (Note that Gri has no way, in this code, to know that the user
might be thinking of creating an image from the grid. An image might be read in
separately, linked with a grid yet to be created, etc.)

* other files will be documented as I get to work on them. --DK
